#  Final project on crowd level of trains

# Project description
In this project the crowd level of the train route between Zandvoort and Overveen is predicted. Data exploration and preprocessing is done and a logistic model and a decision tree are fitted and the results are displayed.

# File description
In this repository there are four notebooks and one folder with three datasets.
In the data_exploration.ipynb the business understanding, data understanding and data exploration is done on the classification and weather data.
In the data_preprocessing.ipynb the data preprocessing is done and the classification and weather data are merged to one csv.
In the logistic_regression.ipynb a logistic regression model is build on the merged dataset. 
In the decision_tree.ipynb a decision tree model is build on the merged dataset and results are displayed.
The folder contains the data of the classification, weather and the merged dataset from data_reprocessing.ipynb and results are displayed.

The notebooks are documented with markdown to assist in understanding the notebook.
