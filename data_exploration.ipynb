    "The route between Zandvoort and Overveen is a route with quite a lot of day travelers, because of the beach at Zandvoort. This would suggest more travelers on hot summer days. When it is already hot outside it would not be ideal to be in a very crowded (hot) train. To give these travelers an option to travel with a slightly less crowded train we like to predict the crowd level of the train. Such that we can communicate this with the traveler as an indication of how crowdy the train is."
